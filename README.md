# StudySpotter

## Overview
StudySpotter is a comprehensive, full-stack web application designed to help University of Waterloo students discover, share, and review their favourite study locations throughout the Waterloo region. This project is built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB for the backend and Bootstrap with EJS templating for the frontend.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations:** Students can create, read, update, and delete their preferred study spots.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login system powered by Passport.js.
- **Image Upload:** Allows users to upload images of their study spots using Cloudinary API.
- **Geocoding:** Convert address inputs to geographic coordinates using Mapbox Geocoding API.
